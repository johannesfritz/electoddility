p(X becomes president | 2020: X vs Trump)

## backing out head-to-head odds

In short, one can back this out from the odds implied by three Betfair betting markets ([Presidency](https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/politics/market/1.128151441) | [Democratic nomination](https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/politics/market/1.128161111) | [Republican nomination](https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/politics/market/1.128999265)) plus a few assumptions. 

The main assumption is the average probability of a Republican winning the presidency given that s/he's nominated instead of Trump (p(Repulican wins|Republican nominee != Trump). I asumme 30% but could make arguments for other values below 50%. All that does is shift around the Democrats' lines vertically, though. 

Longer version to follow, if necessary.
